## Fisheye-Dewarping

### Background
There is an object in Lexivalley Inc. which offers real-time alerts to nearby drivers 
when there is an accident or impaired driving event happening around the area. 
The project belongs to the categories of computer vision and vehicle-to-everything (V2X).

Demanded by this project, the circular fisheye camera image should be warped into a flat image.
The input is a video from fisheye camera. The output should be a dewarped video.

### Progress:
1. First, we check if the candidate code is workable.
   We use PyCharm to create an object and run the code, and it works.
